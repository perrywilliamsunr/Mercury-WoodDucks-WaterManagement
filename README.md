# Mercury-WoodDucks-WaterManagement
This repository focuses on the impact of mercury contamination on wood ducks in the Lower Carson River watershed. It analyzes spatial-temporal Hg patterns, effects of drought, and Hg levels in feathers and food sources. The findings suggest water management strategies to mitigate mercury exposure in wildlife.
